# Database_Solution

Data translation

We currently use MS Access as the database and import and export data files to synchronize data from point to point. We now need a more efficient and modern solution that's real time. We are open to any type of database solution as long as it is light and no/low cost. We will have an internet connection but it may not be the most robust.
